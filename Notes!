even though am already stupid but yeah this is super stupid
###########################################################
syntex 
for value in {1..2..3}
	      |  |  |____________z
	      |  |____________y
	      |___________x	 
if x > y ; then is ++
elif x < y; then is --
where "z" show the value to increment or decrement
elif x == y; then show the value the first value
